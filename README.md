### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
.Launching in May and or June are your best bets to successed. If you have to launch in another month that is not May or June, avoid launching in December.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
.If you can make it with a goal less than $5000 that is best chances for success. If you need more money than go big and ask for over 50000. Asking for anthing between $5000 and $35000 lowers your chances of success. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
.Not knowing how popular the plays where in the area or how repesected an known the people was asking for the money. Also not knowing the state of the economy when each one was released.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
.Building a table and graph for the amount of backers there was, average donation, by year and month. See if there any trends that could confim why May and June deal well. Then building a chart for all the donation for goals over $50000
